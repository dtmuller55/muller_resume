Sometimes people state a purpose, goal, or objective at the top of their resume to let potential employers know what you want. In your case, it's probably work experience in Data science. Obviously jazz it up a little. Look at mine for a generic start.

Change the hyperlinks to lead to your GitHub, Linkedin, etc.

Your Education and Work History look good.

Near the end of the resume is your chance to add context and personality to you. I have an Awards section. If you have any awards or accomplishments, put them in this section (e.g. Eagle Scout Award). Last I have an Interests/Hobbies section to make sure the interviewers know I have a personality.
